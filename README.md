This repository contains some R source code as well as outputs for projects of UCLA Math 191.

####Project 2:
Apply multiple linear regression technique in two different fashion to study a couple of stock indices. Valuate these two different techniques by calculating sharpe, annual return and cumulative PNL.

####Project 3:
For the given set of financial instruments, perform the following:
* Perform an in-sample analysis with PCA and ordinary multiple linear regression
* Perform an out-sample analysis (sliding-window approach) without PCA and KNN-regression
* Perform an out-sample analysis with PCA but no KNN-regression (k=10)
* Perform an out-sample analysis with PCA and KNN-regreesion (k=10)
